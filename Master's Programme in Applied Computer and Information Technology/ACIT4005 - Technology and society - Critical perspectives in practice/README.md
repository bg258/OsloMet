# ACIT4005 - Technology and society: Critical perspectives in practice
Welcome to the course Technology and society: Critical perspectives in practice!

In this course we will discuss concrete questions and concrete cases concerning the intersection of technology and society. Questions like: How is society shaped by technology? Can technology save the environment and eradicate poverty? Can technology save democracy? What is the future of programmers if Ai can do all the coding? What is data anyway, and how is policing and the justice system shaped by an orietation towards digital data? 

These are questions that are not necessarily so easy to answer, at least not with two lines under the answer. However, the purpose of this course is not to arrive at a final answer, but to open up a critical reflection on what technology is, how it changes society and how technology makes us interact, sense, create, legitimate knowledge and think in new ways.

In the modules here in Canvas, you will find most of what you need to know in order to navigate this course:

* List over lectures and seminars
* Preparatory stuff
* Powerpoints from the lectures
* Examination guide

I am looking forward to meeting all of youl! My name is Trine Krigsvoll HaagensenLinks to an external site., and I am associate professor here at the Department of Computer Science. I developed this course in order to offer the students a variety of perspectives on what technologies are and what they do, and as a possibility to enhance critical reflection and discuss ethical, social, and political challenges arising at the intersection of technology and society. After all, as more and more crucial tasks are delegated to technologies such as Ai, and we ourselves and our societies are shaped, governed and enabled by these technologies, what else could we do?

Contact me at trinekri@oslomet.no if you have any question.

Best regards,

Trine
